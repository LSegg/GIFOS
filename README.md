# GIFOS
 This a project from a course I'm taking, Desarrollo Web Full Stack by Ac√°mica.  The challenge is to create an interactive web application to share animated GIFs, putting into practice the fundamentals of programming and using JavaScript by obtaining data from the API of Giphy.com working with asynchronism and taking advantage of native browser tools such as obtaining images through the webcam.
